This repo contains data science/machine learning/math learning materials, deep learning(DL) papers reviews and presentations on DL/Data Science topics, 


The repo contains three main parts: 

- Deep Learning Paper Reviews(mostly in Hebrew)

- Learning Materials on Data Science and Machine Learning 
Includes content about programming (mostly python), Machine Learning book, mathematical tools required to master Machine Learning, interesting Math resources (all in English)

- Slidesets (WIP), which I presented in meetups and lectures

Some folders contain a file called useful_links.txt with links to relevant (to this folder) materials

The repo is being constanly updated, Im adding new materials all the time. If you have a good material on DS, ML, math, please let me know and I'll add it to the repo.

Thanks in advance!
